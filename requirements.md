# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication system that supports multiple sign-in methods including traditional email/password registration, Google OAuth, and Facebook OAuth. The system will be built with a loosely coupled architecture using Python FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, Git for version control, Docker for containerization and CI/CD, and a custom PostgreSQL database setup with database-first approach. The authentication system will provide secure user registration, login, and session management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the frontend and backend to be loosely coupled with clear separation of concerns, so that they can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently while maintaining system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system architecture THEN the frontend SHALL communicate with the backend exclusively through well-defined REST API contracts
2. WHEN the backend processes requests THEN it SHALL return standardized JSON responses with consistent error handling
3. WHEN deploying services THEN the frontend and backend SHALL be containerized separately with independent deployment pipelines
4. WHEN scaling the system THEN each service SHALL be able to scale horizontally without affecting other services
5. WHEN developing features THEN teams SHALL be able to work on frontend and backend independently using API contracts as the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete Docker setup for the application, so that the development environment can be easily set up and the system can be deployed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the backend THEN the system SHALL have a Dockerfile for the Python FastAPI application with all required dependencies
2. WHEN setting up the frontend THEN the system SHALL have a Dockerfile for the React application with Node.js environment
3. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL have a PostgreSQL Docker container configuration
4. WHEN running the application THEN docker-compose SHALL orchestrate all services (frontend, backend, database) with proper networking
5. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL automatically handle service dependencies and port mapping

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Git version control setup for both frontend and backend, so that code changes can be tracked and the basic application setup can be pushed to repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the project THEN Git SHALL be configured with monorepo structure containing separate directories for frontend, backend, and infrastructure
2. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include proper .gitignore files for Python, Node.js, and Docker
3. WHEN creating basic setup THEN the system SHALL have minimal working FastAPI backend and React frontend with health check endpoints
4. WHEN pushing to Git THEN the system SHALL include Docker configuration files, API documentation, and project structure
5. WHEN running the basic setup THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be accessible and communicating through defined API endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a database-first approach with proper table structure including email verification, so that user data is organized and accessible through FastAPI with proper account verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the database THEN the system SHALL create a users table with proper schema (id, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, status, verification_token, provider, provider_id, created_at, updated_at)
2. WHEN connecting to database THEN FastAPI SHALL use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/verify-email)
4. WHEN handling database migrations THEN the system SHALL use Alembic for schema versioning
5. WHEN accessing user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper database connection pooling

### Requirement 5

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with status "pending" in the PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL send a verification email with a unique verification token
4. WHEN a user enters an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Email already registered"
5. WHEN a user enters passwords that don't match THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Passwords do not match"
6. WHEN a user clicks the verification link in email THEN the system SHALL update their status to "verified"
7. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a page indicating "Please check your email to verify your account"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure password validation during registration, so that my account is protected with a strong password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL validate it meets minimum security requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
2. WHEN a user enters password and confirm password THEN the system SHALL verify both fields match exactly
3. WHEN passwords don't match THEN the system SHALL display real-time validation error "Passwords do not match"
4. WHEN password is weak THEN the system SHALL display specific requirements not met
5. WHEN password meets all criteria THEN the system SHALL show validation success indicator

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email verification functionality to be implemented, so that only users with valid email addresses can access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL generate a unique verification token and store it in the database
2. WHEN sending verification email THEN the system SHALL use SMTP configuration to send emails with verification links
3. WHEN a user clicks verification link THEN the system SHALL validate the token and update user status from "pending" to "verified"
4. WHEN a user tries to login with unverified account THEN the system SHALL display "Please verify your email before logging in"
5. WHEN verification token expires THEN the system SHALL provide option to resend verification email

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to sign in using my email and password, so that I can access my account and use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
